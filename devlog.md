Understanding of the project:

cpu.py - lanches mem.py as subprocess and commmunicates
mem.py - reads commands to "write" or "read" until "hault"
logger.py - take input into log file w/ timestamp, action, message until "QUIT"
encryption.py - set passkey,encrypt, or decrypt and output results until "QUIT" 
driver.py - gives menu of commands  where input/result is logged until "QUIT"
logfile.txt - text file of logs

This is the same day, all I have done is gathered ideas about the project along with 
adding cpu.py and mem.py into this respritory as well as the VS code I am using to run the project.
I also ran python cpu.py to confirm cpu.py and mem.py are working correctly. 

The part of my code I will be working on now is the logger.py
You call it by doing "logger.py examplefile.txt"
I will get the [action "Message"] input along with the ouput of 
[timestamp [action] "message"]
The next log will be the final logger.py confirmation along with the push of the code to the 
main branch when it is done.
